# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this project, I used SQLAlchemy to query a database and Flask to portray the information I queried on a webpage. I performed my main queries on jupyter notebook using SQLAlchemy. I queried this data from a sqlite file that has data on precipitation in Hawaii. I then used VS Code to create an app using flask, and transfered the queries I used on jupyter notebook into the app.

The databases I used in this project are in the Resources folder located in the SurfsUp folder. My SQLAlchemy queries were performed in the Climate_Analysis file located in the SurfsUp folder. The flask app I created is located in the app file which can be found in the SurfsUp folder.
